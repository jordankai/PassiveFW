main_passive.m give an example of ambient noise with roadside geometry.
I develop this code mainly for modeling small scale geometry in near-surface seismic imaging.
Just remember the time step dt is the key parameter that affect calculation speed.

I will add more detailed instructions later !
For any suggestion, question or bug-fix, please don't hesitate to contact me.
